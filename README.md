`easygraphql-firebase` is global package that will create a GraphQL server connected
to your Firebase real-time database just using a GraphQL schema.

## Installation
```bash
$ npm install easygraphql-firebase -g
```

## Usage
To get started with your GraphQL-Firebase server you need to have:

+ GraphQL schema.
+ Firebase API key.
+ Firebase database url.

Create a GraphQL schema file.
```graphql
type Student {
  key: ID!
  age: Int!
  name: String!
}

type School {
  key: ID!
  location: String!
  students: Int!
  name: String!
  student: Student!
}

input StudentInput {
  age: Int!
  name: String!
}

input SchoolInput {
  location: String!
  students: Int!
  name: String!
  phone: String!
  student: StudentInput!
}

type Query {
  getStudentByUsername(name: String!): Student!
  getStudents: [Student!]!
  getSchool(name: String!): School!
  getSchools: [School!]!
}

type Mutation {
  createStudent(input: StudentInput!): Student!
  createSchool(input: SchoolInput!): School!
}
```

#### Run on your terminal

```bash
$ easygraphql-firebase
```
by default it is going to run the server automatically.

You can set flags to prevent running it automatically, set apiKey, set databaseUrl and also pass the schema name.

```bash
$ easygraphql-firebase schema.gql --apiKey=<YOUR_API_KEY> --databaseUrl=<YOUR_DATABASE_URL> --start=false
```

and select the GraphQL schema you want to use; also, it will ask for some env variables,
you can press enter and add them later.

`easygraphql-firebase` will start creating the whole project, and also it will add to the new schema
some new queries, like
```graphql
type Query {
  ....
  getUserByKey(key: ID!): User
  getSchoolByKey(key: ID!): School
}
```

also, there is going to be a folder to make tests, it is using [`easygraphql-tester`](https://github.com/EasyGraphQL/easygraphql-tester)
so, if you want to test your queries and mutations, visit the folder `test` and add on cases your own tests, add a name to identify them.

```js
const cases = [
  {
    name: 'Should get school by key',
    query: `
      {
        getSchoolByKey(key: "-LTYEa4geFv52c5rzpCS") {
          name
        }
      }
    `,
    expected: true
  }
]
```

### Result
```shell
Validate query
    âœ“ Should validate the query: Should get school by key
```

## Collections

The collections that are going to be query are going to be the name of the expected type in lowercase with an `s` at the end.

E.g
If you have this query `getStudentByUsername(name: String!): Student!` the resolver is going to search on Firebase
for a collection called `students`

## Run it
To run your project visit the generated folder and run:

```bash
$ npm run start
```

## Recommendations
This a **beta** version, so the recommendations are:

+ Just set one argument to the queries.
+ Add nested fields from the input, if you want to add custom logic, edit the resolvers.
+ Test your queries / mutations.
+ If you are having a lot of records, and you are making a query that returns an array
  add a limit to it!
